# ChuckNorrisApp
Display jokes from a Chuck Norris Api as well as other features :)

Architecture - MVVM : Model - View - ViewModel
  This was used because...
  - Viewmodels with livedata
  - less boilerplate code as MVP
  
Dependency Injection - Koin 
  This was used because...
  - coroutines 
  - less boilerplate than dagger
  - integrated with kotlin viewmodels?
  
Retrofit for API calls
Moshi for parsing
Fragments for each screen
Utility file for functions
